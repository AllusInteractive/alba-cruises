This project was created as part of my studies during my BSc Degree in Interactive Media. It now forms part of my [portfolio](https://www.reecemorgan.co.uk)

## Development Server

Run `ng serve -o` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The site will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
<!--
## Code Scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` (`ng g c component-name`) to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.
